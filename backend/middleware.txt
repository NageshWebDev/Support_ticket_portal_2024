What is Middleware in Express JS
Middleware is a request handler that allows you to intercept and manipulate
requests and responses before they reach route handlers.

Types of Middleware:

1.Application-level middleware: Bound to the entire application using app.use() or app.METHOD()
 and executes for all routes.

2.Router-level middleware: Associated with specific routes using router.use() or router.METHOD()
 and executes for routes defined within that router.

3.Error-handling middleware: Handles errors during the request-response cycle.
Defined with four parameters (err, req, res, next).

4.Built-in middleware: Provided by Express (e.g., express.static, express.json, etc.).

5.Third-party middleware: Developed by external packages (e.g., body-parser, morgan, etc.).
